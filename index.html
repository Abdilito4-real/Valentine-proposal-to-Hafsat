                        <h2>My Dearest Hafsat,</h2>
                        <p>I may not be your first, your last, or your only. May be you have loved before and may have love again.</p>
                         <p>But if you loves me now what matters? You're not perfect, you aren't either, and the two of us will never be perfect. </p>
                         <p>But if you can make me laugh at least once, and make me think twice, and admits to being human and making mistakes, i won't let you go and i'll give you my best.</p>
                         <p>
                        You dont recite poetry for me, you're not thinking about me all the time, but if you can give me a part of you that you knows it can't be broken by the trusted(YOUR HEART).</p>
                        <p>
                    I won't hurt you neither change you and i won't expect more than you can give me, i won't over analyze. I'll smile when you makes me happy, yell when you makes me mad, and miss you when you're not there. I'll love you with all my heart when you give me your love.</p>
                    <p>Because there are not perfect girls, but there will always be one girl who is perfect for me which is YOU</p>
                    <h3>I may not be your first love, first kiss, first sight, or first date but i wan't to be your last everything.</h3>
